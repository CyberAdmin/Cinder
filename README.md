This project was my high school senior year AP Computer Science final project using Java servlets. It's a survey-based game/web app
where the user 'swipes' left if they don't like a particular product/company or right if they do.

The user may earn points and redeem these points for prizes, etc.

This project was done in about one week. Apologies for poorly written documentation/comments.
